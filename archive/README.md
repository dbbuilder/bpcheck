# Archived PWA/Vue.js Documentation (October 20, 2025)

This directory contains documentation archived during the pivot from PWA (Vue.js) to React Native + Expo native mobile apps.

**Reason for Archive**: PWA architecture cannot access native photo libraries or provide optimal camera integration required for the blood pressure reading capture workflow.

**Pivot Date**: October 20, 2025
**Archived Files**: Original README.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, TODO.md referencing Vue.js/PWA implementation

See ARCHITECTURE.md for details on the architectural decision.
